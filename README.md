# Project Eden

## Brain-storming:
We decided that we would erect a new company, specialized in constructing new cities. But not just **_any_** city! They are the CITIES OF TOMORROW.   
Our website explains how we see those cities.

## Tasks:
We each made our own section on this webpage:  

| Developer | Web section |
| --------- | :---------: |
| Kin       | Front-page  |
| Yasmine   |  Landscape  |
| Aaron     |   Drones    |
| Kris      |   Energy    |

## Why:
Basically because Filip said we had to this! But also because we like doing this. This project is our "Final" project, at least for HTML and (S)CSS. And thus making us a "not-so-junior junior-web-developer".  
You can find our project ***here(!!!!)**. We've put this project on Github, so we can publish it and show it to ours parents so they can be proud of us that we finally do something productively with our lives.

### License:
The license can be found in **this** repo under the name "license.txt"
