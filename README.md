# Project Eden

## Brain-storming:
We decided that we would erect a new company, specialized in constructing new cities. But not just **_any_** city! They are the CITIES OF TOMORROW.   
Our website explains how we see those cities.

## Tasks:
We each made our own section on this webpage:  

| Developer | Web section |
| --------- | :---------: |
| Kin       | Front-page  |
| Yasmine   |  Landscape  |
| Aaron     |   Drones    |
| Kris      |   Energy    |
