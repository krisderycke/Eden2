          Imagine homes whose very building material is salted with dormant
          limestone-producing bacteria, which awaken upon contact with moisture
          and repair any cracks or structural damage. There will be “digestion
          tanks” full of anaerobic bacteria, to dispose of our waste; and our
          homes will produce, store, and reuse their own energy, using
          “microbial fuel cell stacks” and more <strong>efficient</strong> solar
          panels to generate electricity, and power-banks like the Tesla
          powerwall to store it against future use. Personal homes will be
          almost <strong>fully independent</strong> of a dangerously overtaxed
          energy grid.

      <p>
        A standard solar panel consists of a layer of silicon cells, a metal
        frame, a glass casing and various wiring to allow current to flow from
        the silicon cells. Silicon is a nonmetal with conductive properties that
        allow it to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity. When light
        interacts with a silicon cell, it causes electrons to be set into
        motion, which initiates a flow of electric current. This is known as the
        “photovoltaic effect,” and it describes the general functionality of
        solar panel technology. We aim to provide every house with solarpanels
        and are always searching to create newer and better ones. The general
        photovoltaic process, as described above, works through the following
        steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The silicon photovoltaic solar cell absorbs solar radiation</li>
        <li>
          When the sun’s rays interact with the silicon cell, electrons begin to
          move
        </li>
        <li>
          Moving electrons creates a flow of electric current, captured by nodes
          and wiring in the panel
        </li>
        <li>
          Wires feed this direct current (DC) electricity to a solar inverter to
          be converted to alternating current (AC) electricity
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our goal is to upscale the amount of energy to solar panels can create.
        The remainders of the energy will go to the main power gird, providing
        bigger buildings and storing energy in the back-up generators.

    <h1 class="kris-title">Tidal Energy</h1>
    <div class="para-cont">
      <p>
        The creation of tidal energy results from the movement of ocean water
        associated with the rise and fall of tides. The first tidal power plant
        was established in La Rance, France, and the largest is in South Korea:
        the Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station. Where we are based, many waves hit
        the sea shore and they will provide us with
        <strong>clean energy</strong>. Tidal stream generators are very similar
        to wind turbines except their below the water surface instead of above
        or on land. The turbine and generator converts the movement of water
        coming from change in tide, the kinetic energy, into electricity. Water
        is 830 times denser than air and therefore can generate electricity at
        lower speeds than wind turbines.
